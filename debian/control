  # SerialPacker
  .
  This is an Arduino and Python library for sending and receiving
  variable-sized, CRC16-protected data packets.
  .
  It is optimized for daisy-chaining multiple modules onto an ad-hoc bus,
  i.e. each member of the chain forwards the data it receives to the next
  device as quickly as possible, i.e. without waiting for the end of the
  packet and without requiring RAM for the whole thing. This reduces RAM
  usage and speeds up processing, particularly if your string is long.
